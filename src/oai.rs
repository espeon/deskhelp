## DeskThing Troubleshooting Guide

This guide outlines common issues encountered while setting up and using DeskThing, along with their respective solutions.

**Hardware Issues:**

*   **AMD 5000 Series Cards (macOS):** USB compatibility issues can cause read-only mode, boot loops, unrecognized devices, and unusual behavior. The most reliable workaround is to use a different computer for setup, use a different cable, or use a different port
* **Bulkmode Failure During Flashing:** If flashing fails, try the following:
    *   Use higher quality, shorter USB cables.
    *   Connect directly to your computer's I/O ports.
    *   Disconnect other USB devices.
    *   Experiment with both "libusbk" and "winusb" drivers.
    *   Try both USB-A to USB-C and USB-C to USB-C cables.
    *   Repeat the flashing process multiple times.
*   **Car Thing Flashes Successfully but Isn't Detected:** If the Car Thing displays the "Welcome to Spotify" screen after flashing but isn't recognized by DeskThing:
    *   Try a different USB port (preferably on the back of your PC) and/or cable.
    *   **(Windows):** Check Device Manager for an ADB interface or an unknown device. If an unknown device appears, try a new port/cable or reflash.

**Software Issues:**

*   **"app local not found (is it running)" Error:** Uninstall the utility app. Its functionality has been integrated into the base app since version 0.9.0.
*   **Car Thing Connects But No Audio:** In DeskThing settings (bottom left), navigate to the Music section, set a playback location and save.
*   **"Getting Audio Data" / "Waiting For Song":** Ensure audio is actively playing on your chosen source and press "Play" or "Skip" on the Car Thing.

**Setup & Configuration:**

*   **Setting up Car Thing:**
    1.  Set up Car Thing with ADB (see the latest tutorial on <https://deskthing.app/youtube>).
    2.  Open DeskThing.
    3.  Go to the "Clients" tab.
    4.  Connect your Car Thing and click "Refresh ADB." (See Known Issues if this fails.)
    5.  Ensure a client is staged. If not, click "Downloads" (left of "Restart Server") and download the latest.
    6.  Click the "Configure" button.
*   **Enabling RNDIS (Windows & Linux):** RNDIS is known to not be as reliable as other methods, but is an alternative if you want to avoid using ADB
    1. Prerequisites: Complete the Car Thing setup guide (above) on a Windows or Linux host.
    2. In DeskThing settings, open "Client Settings."
    3. Check "RNDIS" and click "SAVE."
    4. Open "Device" and run the Firewall script. (A firewall verification failure is acceptable.)
    5. Manually push the staged web app.
*   **Changing Brightness:**
    1.  Go to "Device Details."
    2.  Adjust the brightness slider.
    *Note: The backlight process restarts upon Car Thing reboot, requiring manual disabling each time.*
*   **Installing Spotify App:**
    1.  Navigate to Downloads -> Apps -> Spotify.
    2.  Download the latest version of the Spotify app.
    3.  Navigate to Notifications -> Requests and open the request from Spotify.
    4.  Log in to the Spotify developer dashboard.
    5.  Access your profile and go to the dashboard.
    6.  Create a new app.
    7.  Enter the Callback URL.
    8.  Obtain the App ID and Secret.
    9.  Ensure a success message appears.
    10. Set the playback location (for desyncing issues, set refresh interval to 15 seconds).
        *Troubleshooting:* Verify the Callback URL, ensure port 8888 is free, and try restarting the app or computer. Make sure the app is set as the media app. Double check Client ID and Secret. Double check that redirect URL is deskthing://a?app=spotify on both the deskthing app and spotify dashboard

**Known Issues (Updated):**

*   **AMD 5000 Series Cards:** USB issues may cause read-only mode, boot loops, or device recognition problems. A BIOS update might help, but using a different computer for setup is the most reliable solution.
*   **Bulkmode Failed While Flashing:** Try again with: better cables, direct connection to I/O, disconnected USB devices, both "libusbk" and "winusb" drivers, and both USB-A to C and C-C cables.
*   **"app local not found (is it running)":**  Uninstall the utility app, as its functionality is integrated into the base app since v0.9.0.
*   **Car Thing Connects But No Audio:** Go to Settings -> Music, set a playback location and save.
*   **"Getting Audio Data" / "Waiting For Song":** Make sure audio is playing and press "Play" or "Skip" on the Car Thing.
*   **Car Thing Flashes Successfully But Isn't Detected:** If the Car Thing shows "Welcome to Spotify" after flashing but is not detected: try a different USB port (back of PC preferred) or a new cable. Check Device Manager for an ADB interface; if an unknown device appears, try a new port/cable or reflash.
**[Guide] DeskThing on your Phone:**
1. Download DeskThing for your OS from <https://deskthing.app/>
2. Run the installer.
3. Download a client.
4. Open the QR Code.
5. Scan the QR code. If you have multiple IPs, try a different one if one doesn't work. Ensure the phone is on the same wifi as the server/host

**[Guide] Using the Restart Script:**
*   **Prerequisites:**  This script may cause issues if you have AMD issues. It's only for Windows, and will break things if you have AMD issues.
1.  Ensure ADB works by running `adb devices` in the terminal. If not, follow the ADB setup in the video at <https://youtu.be/Y0paq_qhG5M?si=14TIgC-6B9PjVfRy&t=622> (10:22 mark). Restart terminal and run `adb devices` again.
2.  Download the restart script: `restart_adb.zip`
3.  Plug in the car thing and ensure it shows up when you run `adb devices`
4.  Double-click `push_usbgadget.bat` and let it run. This only needs to be run once per flash.

**[Resource] Debugging Steps:**
*   **Reporting a bug:**  Screenshot ADB Device and NDIS Interface from Device Manager, list the image flashed, and link the guide followed.
*   **Flashing Errors:** Refer to video and wiki resources.  Try new cables, ports, powered hubs. If terbium doesn't detect, check Device Manager for GX-CHIP. Run `irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex` in the terminal. For "unable to enter burn mode" try holding buttons 1&4, make sure screen stays off, and if not, try a thicker cable or a BIOS port.
*   If terbium starts flashing but fails: remove CarThing driver from Device Manager and repeat until its gone. It might take upwards of 15 times.  Run `irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex` ONCE.
*   **Detection Errors:** (DeskThing) If unable to see the device, install ADB and run with sudo on Mac/Linux; Enable Global ADB in DeskThing settings. Try restarting the server. For Linux PCs, try the 8.9.2-norndis image and use the BIOS port.
*   If the client doesn't connect, check your firewall, and ensure you are on the same Wi-Fi. If the connection disconnects after 5 minutes, run the Restart Script.
*   **No album art** on Mac/Linux: Follow the quickfix in ⁠"v0.10.2 Not displaying album art".
*   **Common Error Messages:** "Unable to find app local...": uninstall Utility. Spotify errors (OAuth, 403): ensure Spotify Premium, ensure it's updated, may be hitting API limits, let it "cool off".  For Spotify skipping songs: Disable and enable Spotify in AppsList. If Spotify is stuck on "Loading Song", follow "v0.10.2 Not displaying album art" or enable refresh interval in settings. If Car Thing is lagging, try refresh interval with 15 seconds or 10.

**[Guide] Setting up your Car Thing**
1. Set up Car Thing with ADB: follow the latest tutorial at <https://deskthing.app/youtube>
2. Open the DeskThing software
3. Go to the Clients tab
4. Plug in your Car Thing and hit "Refresh ADB".  If this fails, refer to the Known Issues.
5. Ensure a client is staged. If not, click "Downloads" to the left of "Restart Server".
6. Click the "Configure" button.

**Flashing Troubleshooting:**
*   If you're having trouble flashing your Car Thing, the following steps may help.
    *   **Windows - Device Not Showing Up:** You may need to install drivers. Open PowerShell and run: `irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex`
    *   **Windows - "Access Denied" Error:** Uninstall existing drivers (GX-CHIP or WorldCup Device in Device Manager), selecting "Attempt to remove the driver for this device." Multiple uninstalls may be needed. Then, run the driver install command again `irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex`
    *   **Linux - "Access Denied" Error:** Set up udev rules. Open a terminal and run: `curl -fsSL https://terbium.app/install-rules | bash`
    *   **Device Not Appearing (Boots Normally):** You haven't booted into USB mode. Hold buttons 1 & 4 while plugging in. If it still boots normally, try different cables.
    *   **Something Else Wrong?** Open a thread in the DeskThing Discord: <https://deskthing.app/discord>.

**Q/A about what DeskThing is and is not**
Reference these facts when asked questions about the state of DeskThing:

Q: Is DeskThing open source?
A: Yes, it is. All of the source code can be found at <https://github.com/ItsRiprod/DeskThing>

Q: Is bluetooth supported / on the road map?
A: No, bluetooth is not supported in the current version but is in the roadmap. It is not a priority feature at the moment.

Q: Is wifi supported / on the road map?
A: For the Car Thing, it is not. WiFI is only supported via third-party apps such as phones / tablets. The Car Thing does not have wifi capabilities.

Q: What is the callback url for [app]
A: There are two forms of callback urls. https://deskthing.app/a?app=[app] and http://localhost:8888/callback/[app]. In most cases, the first one is preferred. For spotify, you HAVE to use the first one OR 172.168.0.1:8888/callback/spotify as 'localhost' does not work. For discord, you cannot use deskthing:// and must use localhost. 

Q: What do I need a spotify premium account for?
A: You need a Spotify Premium account to use certain features of DeskThing, such as controlling music, getting playlists, or skipping tracks. While the free version does work, it is limited in functionality. You can download Local Audio and get the controls though.

Q: Is there a mobile app?
A: No, there is not a mobile app. However, you can use DeskThing on your phone by hosting the server on your computer and connecting to it via your phone's web browser. See the guide above for more information. A dedicated mobile app is on the roadmap but low priority.

Q: How do I remap buttons / general questions about button remapping
A: Button remapping is not fully implemented as of version v0.11.X and will be reworked in v1.0. It is recommended to leave Button Mapping as is as modifying them may lead to instability. If you need to, you can go to Clients / Mapping and make a new profile to edit the mappings. You must make a new profile prior to being able to edit mappings, and must save the profile for changes to take place.

Q: What does the restart script even do?
A: The restart script lets the device reconnect if it loses USB connection. This leads to less dropout and helps maintain a stable connection. It will not fix a faulty cable and can sometimes misbehave on AMD 5000 series cards. It can be configured in Clients -> Devices -> Device Details -> ADB -> Setup Restart Script button

Q: General issues where callback urls are not working or port 8888 seems unreachable
A: Go to Settings -> Server Settings and click Configure Firewall. If it fails, you may need to manually add an inbound rule for TCP port 8888.
